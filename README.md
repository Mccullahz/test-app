# This app is my intro to React

## The goal of this project is first to learn more about the react framework, and secondly create a scheduling app.
- By creating this app I will learn a lot about the framework and JavaScript in general. 
-The purpose of this app is to potentially give my S/O 
an application in which she can schedule appointments
## This app is non-functional at the moment.
-There is not a lot to it, but I am active in the development of the 
application.
