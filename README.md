# This app is my intro to React

## The intial goal is to create a good looking UI that can be used universally.
    -By creating this UI I will set myself for a successful app, regardless of what path I choose to take with this.

### After creating a great UI, I will then transfer focus to the function of the app.
    -Though this wokrflow is backwards for most creation of apps, I feel as though the experience with creating something pleasurable to the eyes is something I need to work on right now. I have more experience creating functional code than pretty visuals.
